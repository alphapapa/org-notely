This package makes it easy to quickly take a note in a new heading displayed in a new indirect buffer.  It's similar to Org's built-in capture functionality, but it's not limited to one capture "session", so you can pop up a new note at any time, without interfering with other activities in Emacs.

Used with [[https://github.com/alphapapa/yequake][Yequake]], it can also pop open a new Emacs frame.

** MELPA

If you installed from MELPA, you're done.

** Quelpa

Installing with [[https://framagit.org/steckerhalter/quelpa][Quelpa]] is easy:

1.  Install [[https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa-use-package#installation][quelpa-use-package]] (which can be installed directly from MELPA).
2.  Add this form to your init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (use-package org-popnote
    :quelpa (org-popnote :fetcher github :repo "alphapapa/org-popnote"))
#+END_SRC

* Usage

:TOC:      0
:END:

1.  Run =M-x customize-group RET org-popnote RET= and configure the options =org-popnote-file= and =org-popnote-outline-path= according to your preferences.
2.  =M-x org-popnote RET= to pop up a new note.

** Yequake

Yequake makes it easy to display =org-popnote= in a new Emacs frame.  Here's an example configuration:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (use-package yequake
    :custom
    (yequake-frames
     (list (cons "org-popnote"
                 (list (cons 'buffer-fns '(org-popnote))
                       (cons 'width 0.25)
                       (cons 'height 0.5))))))
#+END_SRC

Then bind a global keyboard shortcut in your desktop environment to run this command, which pops up a new Emacs frame showing a new =org-popnote= buffer:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  emacsclient -n -e '(yequake-toggle "org-popnote")'
#+END_SRC
