This package makes it easy to quickly take a note in a new heading displayed in a new indirect buffer.  It's similar to Org's built-in capture functionality, but it's not limited to one capture "session", so you can pop up a new note at any time, without interfering with other activities in Emacs.

Used with [[https://github.com/alphapapa/yequake][Yequake]], it can also pop open a new Emacs frame.

** MELPA

If you installed from MELPA, you're done.

** Quelpa

Installing with [[https://framagit.org/steckerhalter/quelpa][Quelpa]] is easy:

1.  Install [[https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa-use-package#installation][quelpa-use-package]] (which can be installed directly from MELPA).
2.  Add this form to your init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (use-package org-notepad
    :quelpa (org-notepad :fetcher github :repo "alphapapa/org-notepad"))
#+END_SRC

* Usage
:PROPERTIES:
:TOC:      0
:END:

1.  Run =M-x customize-group RET org-notepad RET= and configure the options =org-notepad-file= and =org-notepad-outline-path= according to your preferences.
2.  =M-x org-notepad RET= to pop up a new note.

** Yequake

Yequake makes it easy to display =org-notepad= in a new Emacs frame.  Here's an example configuration:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (use-package yequake
    :custom
    (yequake-frames
     (list (cons "org-notepad"
                 (list (cons 'buffer-fns '(org-notepad))
                       (cons 'width 0.25)
                       (cons 'height 0.5))))))
#+END_SRC

Then bind a global keyboard shortcut in your desktop environment to run this command, which pops up a new Emacs frame showing a new =org-notepad= buffer:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  emacsclient -n -e '(yequake-toggle "org-notepad")'
#+END_SRC

This configuration uses [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-sidebar][org-sidebar]] to display a list of =org-notepad= notes, organized by month and year, next to the new-note buffer:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (use-package yequake
    :custom
    (yequake-frames
     '(("org-notepad"
        (buffer-fns (lambda ()
                      (find-file-noselect org-notepad-file))
                    (lambda ()
                      (org-with-wide-buffer
                       (org-global-cycle '(4))
                       (goto-char (org-find-olp '("Notes") 'this-buffer))
                       (org-cycle)
                       (org-tree-to-indirect-buffer)
                       (let ((org-super-agenda-date-format "%Y %B"))
                         (org-sidebar-ql (current-buffer)
                                         '(regexp ".")
                                         :narrow t :sort 'date
                                         :super-groups '((:auto-ts))))
                       (goto-char (org-end-of-subtree))))
                    org-notepad)
        (width . 0.25)
        (height . 0.5)))))
